Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2


Python3 code:

class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count=0
        maxx=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if(nums[i]==1):
                count+=1
                if(count>maxx):
                    maxx=count
            else:
                count=0
        return maxx
